# ExpressAPI - CRUD

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the use of express, a web framework for Node.js.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## CRUD API
This project includes a hardcoded set of members;  normally these would be obtained from a database, but for the pruposes of the tutorial they are hard-coded for the time being.

Users can CRUD members via postman. Future implementations of this web app may include actual forms on the front end. 

## Node packages used
- express
- moment (date/time)
- nodemon
- path
- router
- uuid (generate random ID)

## Future Implementation
- use of forms
- mongoose
- database (e.g. MongoDB Atlas, GCP, SQL etc.)
- a proper front-end
